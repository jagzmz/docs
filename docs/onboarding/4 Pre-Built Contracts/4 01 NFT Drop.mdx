# NFT Drop

thirdweb's drop contracts **lazy mints** your NFT and makes it available to be claimed by your users.

The Drop contract is best used when you want to release a **1-of-1** or **1-of-many** NFT collection, such as a PFP (profile picture) collection, and uses the [ERC721 Standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721). The NFT Drop contract allows you to define the conditions for when and how your users can mint an NFT, including whitelists, release dates, claim limits and delayed reveals.

When you add NFTs to your drop contract, they are **not** minted at this point. You prepare everything for your users so that _they_ can mint the NFT(s). This means the user who claims the NFT is the one who mints it, and it is minted into their wallet. By default, the user is the one who pays the gas fees.

## Dashboard View

From the thirwdeb dashboard, you can [Batch Upload](/typescript/sdk.nftdrop.createbatch) your NFTs using a `.csv` file or a `.json` that file contains the metadata of all your NFTs. Alternatievly, you can click the **Create** button to mint individual NFTs.

Within the dashboard, you're able to see the metadata and owner of all the NFTs in the collection, edit the claim phases, and configure royalty fees.

## Create a Drop Contract

Learn how to create any of thirdweb's pre-built contracts in the [Deploying Contracts page](/getting-started/deploying-contracts).

## Getting the contract in your application

To start using your NFT Drop contract in your application, you'll need to use it's contract address. You can get the contract address from the [dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard).

## Lazy Minting Your NFTs

### Using the dashboard

You can batch upload NFTs through the dashboard by uploading a `.csv` file or a `.json` file that contains the metadata of all your NFTs, alongside the assets (images, videos, etc).

- You must include a `name` column for each NFT in the `.csv` or `json` file
- Asset file names must be sequential. E.g. `0.png`, `1.png`, `2.png`.

You can use our examples to get started:

- [Example CSV File](https://thirdweb.com/example.csv)
- [Example JSON File](https://nightly.thirdweb.com/example.json)

## Setting Claim Phases

A claim phase is a set of conditions that define when and how your users can mint an NFT.

You can have multiple claim phases that occur in sequence.

For each claim phase, you can define:

- When the claim phase will start
- How many NFTs you want to drop
- How much you want to charge per NFT
- What currency you want to use
- Which wallet addreses are allowed to mint (whitelist/allowlist)
- How many NFTs can be claimed per transaction
- How many seconds wallets have to wait between claims

### Using the dashboard

For a more in-depth guide on how to set-up your NFT Drop with multiple claim phases and an allowlist, check out our guide [Release an NFT Drop with an allowlist and multiple claim phases](https://portal.thirdweb.com/guides/create-nft-drop-with-claim-phases).

### Using the thirdweb SDK

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet contract={"NFTDrop"} name={"claimConditions"} />

## Delayed Reveals

Delayed reveals allow you to reveal the contents of the NFT to the user later at a specific date, and show a placeholder asset in the meantime.

### Using the dashboard

After you have uploaded your NFTs, you can choose how you want to reveal your NFTs. You have two options:

- **Reveal upon mint**: Collectors will immediately see the final NFT when they complete the minting.
- **Delayed Reveal**: Collectors will mint your placeholder image, then you reveal at a later time.
