# Token

The Token contract is suited for projects in which you want to create your own currency. This currency can be purchased and traded between users on an exchange, utilized to buy and sell NFTs in a marketplace, and much more.

The Token contract is compliant with the [ERC20](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20) standard.

You could use the Token contract to:

- Create your own cryptocurrency
- Sell your NFTs on the [Marketplace](/pre-built-contracts/marketplace) in your custom token.
- Reward users with tokens for some action they take.

## Create a Token Contract

Learn how to create any of thirdweb's pre-built contracts in the [Deploying Contracts page](/getting-started/deploying-contracts).

To start using your Token contract inside your application, you'll need to use it's contract address. You can get the contract address from the [dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard).

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet contract={"Token"} name={"base"} isGetContractCode />

## Minting Tokens

## Token Balance

### Balance of the connected wallet

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet contract={"Token"} name={"balance"} />

### Balance of a specified wallet
