# NFT Collection

thirdweb's NFT Collection contract is a **1-of-1** or **1-of-many** NFT Collection, that follows the [ERC721 Standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721).

The NFT Collection contract is suitable for when you want to have a collection of NFTs, but **not** "drop" or "release" them for your community to claim.

Unlike the [NFT Drop](/pre-built-contracts/nft-drop) contract, the NFT Collection contract does not **lazy mint** your NFTs. Instead, NFTs are minted immediately when they are added to the collection.

This means you can still transfer the NFTs or sell them on a [Marketplace](/pre-built-contracts/marketplace), and perform any other actions you would expect to do with a NFT.

You could use the NFT Collection contract to:

- Create a 1-of-many collection of your photography
- Create a 1-of-1 NFT that provides special utility
- Mint your artwork as NFTs and then sell them on a [Marketplace](/pre-built-contracts/marketplace)
- Create a community-made NFT collection

## Create an NFT Collection Contract

Learn how to create any of thirdweb's pre-built contracts in the [Deploying Contracts page](/getting-started/deploying-contracts).

## Getting the contract in your application

To start using your NFT Collection contract inside your application, you'll need to use it's contract address. You can get the contract address from the [dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard).

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet
  contract={"NFTCollection"}
  name={"base"}
  isGetContractCode
/>

## Setting Royalty Fees

Royalty fees are fees you earn on secondary sales of your NFTs. For example, if you sell an NFT on the marketplace, and it is then sold again to another user, you will earn a royalty fee.

### Using the dashboard

From the dashboard, in the **Settings** tab you can set the royalty **percentage** and the **address** that should receive the revenue from royalties earned from secondary sales of the assets.

### Using the thirdweb SDK

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet contract={"NFTCollection"} name={"royalty"} />

## Minting NFTs

With an NFT Collection contract, you choose which wallet addresses are able to mint NFTs into your collection.

By default, only you (the smart contract owner) are able to mint NFTs into the collection.

You can specify which wallets can mint in the **Permissions** tab of your NFT Collection, under the **Creator** section.

For more advanced use-cases, such as creating a **community-made collection**, you can use [signature-based minting](/typescript/sdk.erc721signatureminting).

### Using the dashboard

For a more in-depth guide on how to create an NFT Collection, check out our guide here [Minting an NFT](/guides/create-nft-with-no-code).

### Using the thirdweb SDK

#### Mint One NFT

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet contract={"NFTCollection"} name={"mintTo"} />

#### Mint Many NFTs (Batch Mint)

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet contract={"NFTCollection"} name={"mintBatchTo"} />

## Viewing NFTs

Our SDKs provide helpful ways to view the NFTs in your collection.

### One NFT

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet contract={"NFTCollection"} name={"get"} />

### All NFTs

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet contract={"NFTCollection"} name={"getAll"} />

### NFTs owned by a specific wallet

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet contract={"NFTCollection"} name={"getOwned"} />

### Amount of tokens owned by a specific wallet

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet contract={"NFTCollection"} name={"balanceOf"} />

## Transferring NFTs

You can transfer NFTs from one wallet to another.

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet contract={"NFTCollection"} name={"transfer"} />

## Burning NFTs

Burning is the process of removing the token from circulation by sending it to an inaccessible address. It does **not** delete the token from the blockchain.

### Using the dashboard

### Using the SDK

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet contract={"NFTDrop"} name={"burn"} />
